# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Project

**Author**: Liron Shpiegel  
**Project**: FIT – Final Machine Learning Project  
**Notebook**: `flight project f.ipynb`  
**Dataset Source**: flights data (cleaned & preprocessed)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight data and building a machine learning model to predict airline ticket prices based on features such as airline, source, destination, departure time, and duration.

It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and regression modeling using Python tools.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand key factors influencing flight prices.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle nulls, format columns).
- Visualize relationships using bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots.
- Build predictive models (Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## 📁 Files

- `flight project f.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with full pipeline: cleaning, visualization, modeling.
- `flights.csv` – Input dataset (not included in repo – may require user upload if necessary).

---

## 🔍 Key Features Used

- **Airline**  
- **Source / Destination**  
- **Departure / Arrival Time**  
- **Total Duration**  
- **Stops**  
- **Price** (target variable)

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Box plots for price distribution per airline  
- Heatmaps for correlation  
- Line plots and bar charts for trends and outliers  
- Scatter plots for regression predictions  

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

- Linear Regression: baseline performance  
- Random Forest Regressor: improved performance  
- Metrics:  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - R² Score

---

## ✅ Results

- Certain airlines and travel routes have significantly higher prices.
- Random Forest outperformed linear models in prediction accuracy.
- Departure time and total duration are strong predictors of price.
